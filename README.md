# Grading
Simple Beginner Java program
It reads data from a text file in a specific format and process the data. It prints the Answer Keys, Student's answers
( if student's answer is wrong, it gives the correct answer besides it.) and gives the marks of the exam.
It includes 2 class, 1 is the main class, 1 is the class constructor. I have included a few useful functions to avoid the program to have a bug or exception handling while reading data from a text file.
